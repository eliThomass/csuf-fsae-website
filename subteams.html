            <p class="cardhead">Powertrain</p>
            <p class="cardtext">The Powertrain subteam is responsible for everything mechanically related to power storage and delivery, ensuring the car's tractive system operates smoothly and efficiently. Our core components include the accumulator, which houses the batteries and their management systems; the inverter, which converts DC from the accumulator into the three-phase AC required by the motor; and the motor, which is essentially the engine of the vehicle. We’re responsible for the design, cooling, packaging, and structural integration of the accumulator, as well as the liquid cooling system for the motor and inverter. Beyond mechanical work, we collaborate closely with the High Voltage subteam to manage electrical integration both inside and outside the accumulator.New members can look forward to diving into hands-on design, thermal management, and integration challenges to optimize our electric vehicle’s performance.

            <p class="cardhead">Chassis</p>
            <p class="cardtext">The Chassis subteam is responsible for designing and building the frame that serves as the foundation of the FSAE vehicle. Our primary objective is to protect both the driver and critical components while providing a solid interface for all other subteams’ subsystems. We adhere closely to FSAE regulations and collaborate with other groups to ensure seamless integration of their components. To validate our designs, we conduct Finite Element Analysis (FEA) to evaluate strength and torsional stiffness, which is a key indicator of chassis performance. We also carry out testing and validation procedures to guarantee safety and reliability. Finally, our subteam oversees the manufacturing process, using both in-house and external resources to produce a high-quality chassis.

            <p class="cardhead">Suspension</p>
            <p class="cardtext">The suspension team is responsible for designing the physical suspension and steering systems of the car. They work closely with Vehicle Dynamics to hit performance targets and maximize handling. Suspension does extensive mass optimizations across all subsystems, while still ensuring the parts will withstand the loads produced from acceleration, cornering, and braking. The majority of suspension’s parts are machined in-house, which gives new members the opportunity to develop manufacturing skills and a better understanding of realistic design.

        <div class="card" style="background-image: url('assets/images/subteam/aerograd.avif');">
            <p class="cardhead">Aero</p>
            <p class="cardtext">Aerodynamics seeks to harness the capabilities of the air in order to increase downforce, decrease drag, and improve beneficial airflow such that our car sees large upgrades in performance through minor additions in mass. Aerodynamic FSAE rules are generally very relaxed, specifying size, safety, and power constraints, meaning the configurations of aerodynamic components are theoretically endless. MK.X includes a front wing, rear wing, underbody, and bodywork, all of which are designed in SolidWorks CAD, simulated in Siemens Star-CCM+ CFD and Ansys FEA, and manufactured through Autodesk Fusion 360 CAM, carbon fiber layups, and in-house machining practices. All of this design, manufacturing, testing, and eventual practical validation comes together to create a lightweight, carbon fiber aero kit capable of generating considerable downforce with minimized weight and maximum efficiency.
